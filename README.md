Checker Framework Maven Example
===============================

The `CHECKER_FRAMEWORK_HOME` environment variable should be set to the location of the root of the `checker-framework` distribution. For example, on my system the `checker-framework` of `javac` is currently located at `~/Software/checker-framework/1.9.1/checker/bin/javac`, so in my shell profile I have included the following line:

``` {.bash}
export CHECKER_FRAMEWORK_HOME="$HOME/Software/checker-framework/1.9.1"
```
